## History

TorchGeo started as an internship project at [Microsoft's AI for Good Lab](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/ai-for-good-research-lab/) in 2021, with continued support and funding from the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/) and the [National Center for Supercomputing Applications](https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/). Since then, TorchGeo has been adopted by a diverse community of researchers from academia, industry, and government research institutions who have contributed to the success of the library. In 2025, we founded a new TorchGeo _Organization_ to manage the TorchGeo _Project_, with the support of members from the above organizations.
